### What I learned

The best way to understand JavaScript asynchronous concepts and web browsers' APIs is through practice. Therefore, in this challenge, I have used not only the Fetch API but also the async/await syntax to work with the Promise object. This has helped me write code in a more organized way and avoid the need to manually configure promise chains.

```js
async function getAdvice() {
  try {
    const response = await fetch('https://api.adviceslip.com/advice');
    const data = await response.json();
    return data;
  } catch (error) {
    alertError(error);
  }
}
```
